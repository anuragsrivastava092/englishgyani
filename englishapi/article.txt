The stock market seems to be channeling Donald Trump's angry voters. Winners since the election are the archetype of middle America shares of smaller companies, with higher tax rates, which focus on domestic customers. Losers since the election are the globe-trotting elite of the corporate world, behemoths that pay little tax and sell a lot overseas.
At least three factors are working together to help small stocks. First up is corporate taxes, about which President-elect Trump has rare cross-party agreement that Something Must Be Done. That something is likely to mean a big cut to the headline corporate-tax rate, which currently comes in at 39% when state taxes are included, the highest of major countries.
Next is Mr. Trump's promise of a fiscal boost to the economy from wider tax cuts and infrastructure spending, making domestic sales more attractive than the foreign earnings of the multinationals.
