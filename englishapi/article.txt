After making the Aadhaar card mandatory for all candidates appearing for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) to check impersonation, the government is considering extending the requirement to other competitive examinations, Human Resource and Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday.
"This [Aadhaar card requirement] is a work in progress and we will take it to other examinations also because the sanctity of examinations is very important. Aadhaar is a photo identity and a unique identity. In some States we see impersonation, which will be prevented. This is a good thing." Mr. Javadekar told The Hindu in an exclusive interview.
Aspirants seeking entry to the prestigious IITs, NITs and designated institutes, except candidates from Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu and Kashmir, have to write the JEE (Mains) examination in 2017 using their Aadhaar.
There has been a controversy over whether the government can mandate Aadhaar for such activity, with the Supreme Court reminding the government in September that it could not mandate the Aadhaar number for scholarship schemes.
Asked whether the government could demand possession of Aadhaar to appear for an examination, as no service or benefit was being provided, Mr. Javadekar said this was for security purposes.
"It is not about service, it is about identity. Students have their identity card of their college. It is an identity card. It is to make the process transparent," he said.
Mr. Javadekar said the government was preparing a Cabinet note to set up a National Testing Institute to hold competitive examinations for entry into educational institutions in engineering, medical and other fields.
