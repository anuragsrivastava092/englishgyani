Facebook Inc.'s growing clout has spawned a series of prominent controversies-and increased confidence in staring them down.
The flaps extend from its core social network-which has gained so many users that it is now central to discourse in the U.S.-to areas well beyond its original purpose of keeping family and friends in touch, such as selling virtual reality gear and expanding internet access to poor and rural areas.
Facebook's leadership has responded with unwavering confidence punctuated by occasional contrition-as in the case of recent ad metrics problems. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's stalwart defense of the company has at times met with internal dissent as well as outside complaint.
In the past several weeks, Facebook has defended itself against criticism that its platform fueled misinformation and division in the presidential election, assuaged advertisers after inflating user metrics, and reversed a decision on censoring its content after a public spat with the prime minister of Norway. Those followed flare-ups earlier in the year over perceived liberal bias in its "trending topics" feature and claims of cultural insensitivity around the launch of its Free Basics service in India.
