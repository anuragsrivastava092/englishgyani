The government will waive service tax on debit and credit card transactions of up to Rs. 2000 in a bid to promote digital transactions amid cash crunch following the withdrawal of old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes.

A notification to this effect will be tabled by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Parliament. The service tax notification of June 2012 will be amended to include exemption on credit and debit cards, a source said.

Recently, the government asked banks to install additional 10 lakh PoS terminals by March 31 across of the country.
