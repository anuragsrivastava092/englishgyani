The four pieces of legislation required to be passed by Parliament for the roll-out of the Goods and Services Tax will not be tabled in the Winter Session as the sixth meeting of the Goods and Services Tax Council on Sunday failed to reach a consensus while Monday's meeting has been shifted to December 22-23.
The Winter session ends on December 16."Our target is April 1 and we stand by it," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters following the meeting on Sunday.
"The luxury of time is not available to us. April 1 is the first possible day for the GST to be implemented and the last day is constitutionally defined as September 16. So the difference is just five months and 15 days. That's why we don't have the luxury of time."
